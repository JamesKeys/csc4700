Hollaback Girl - Gwen Stefani

Ooh this my [EXPLICIT]
All the girls stamp your feet like this
Few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl
Few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl
This my [EXPLICIT], this my [EXPLICIT]
This my [EXPLICIT], this my [EXPLICIT]
This my [EXPLICIT], this my [EXPLICIT]
This my [EXPLICIT], this my [EXPLICIT]
I heard that you were talking [EXPLICIT]
And you didn't think that I would hear it
People hear you talking like that, getting everybody fired up
So I'm ready to attack, gonna lead the pack
Gonna get a touchdown, gonna take you out
That's right, put your pom-poms down, getting everybody fired up
Few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl
Few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl
This my [EXPLICIT], this my [EXPLICIT]
This my [EXPLICIT], this my [EXPLICIT]
This my [EXPLICIT], this my [EXPLICIT]
This my [EXPLICIT], this my [EXPLICIT]
So that's right dude, meet me at the bleachers
No principals, no student-teachers
Both of us wanna be the winner, but there can only be one
So I'm gonna fight, gonna give it my all
Gonna make you fall, gonna sock it to ya
That's right, I'm the last one standing, and another one bites the dust
Few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl
Few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl
This my [EXPLICIT], this my [EXPLICIT]
This my [EXPLICIT], this my [EXPLICIT]
This my [EXPLICIT], this my [EXPLICIT]
This my [EXPLICIT], this my [EXPLICIT]
Let me hear you say, this [EXPLICIT] is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S!
This [EXPLICIT] is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S!
Again this [EXPLICIT] is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S!
This [EXPLICIT] is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S!
Few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl
Few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl
